# Disaster Recovery Plan Setup with IBM Cloud Virtual Servers

## Introduction

This project provides comprehensive instructions for setting up and deploying a disaster recovery plan using IBM Cloud Virtual Servers. Disaster recovery is crucial for ensuring business continuity in the face of unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or hardware failures. By following these steps, you can establish a robust disaster recovery solution to safeguard your critical systems and data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An active IBM Cloud account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud).
- Virtual Servers on IBM Cloud that you intend to use for disaster recovery.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Identify Critical Systems and Data

- Determine which systems, applications, and data are essential for your organization's operations.
- Categorize these elements based on their importance for business continuity.

### 2. Define Recovery Objectives

- Establish Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for each critical element. RTO is the maximum allowable downtime, while RPO is the maximum acceptable data loss.

### 3. Backup and Data Protection

- Implement regular backups of critical data. You can use various backup solutions or IBM Cloud Object Storage for this purpose.

### 4. Replication Setup

- Configure data replication mechanisms to keep data synchronized between your primary and secondary Virtual Servers. IBM Cloud offers features like block storage snapshots for replication.

### 5. Secondary Virtual Server Setup

- Create a secondary Virtual Server in a different geographic location for redundancy.
- Install and configure the necessary software and applications on this secondary server, mirroring your primary server's setup.

### 6. Network Configuration

- Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect your primary and secondary Virtual Servers securely.

### 7. Disaster Recovery Plan Development

- Create a detailed disaster recovery plan that includes step-by-step procedures for failover and recovery in case of a disaster.
- Document roles and responsibilities for team members and communication protocols.

### 8. Testing and Validation

- Conduct regular disaster recovery tests to ensure the failover process works effectively. Test both full-scale disaster recovery drills and partial recovery scenarios.
- Document and report the outcomes of these tests and use them to refine the plan.

### 9. Failover and Recovery Procedures

- In case of a disaster, initiate the failover procedures to redirect traffic to the secondary Virtual Server.
- Apply your backup data and configurations to the secondary server.
- Continuously monitor the secondary server to ensure it's fully operational.

### 10. Ongoing Maintenance and Monitoring

- Establish a schedule for regular monitoring and maintenance of your disaster recovery setup.
- Keep the disaster recovery plan up to date, reflecting changes in your environment and technology.

### 11. Documentation and Training

- Document the entire disaster recovery process, including configurations, procedures, and test results.
- Train your staff to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities during a disaster.

### 12. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and update the disaster recovery plan to adapt to evolving risks and business requirements.
